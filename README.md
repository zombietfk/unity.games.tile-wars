# tile-swapping-game - Tile Wars!

This is another old unity project of mine! Not sure exactly when this was made, but hazard to guess around 2018

Very simply, the point is to swap tiles to make units and end up controlling more of the battle area than the enemies being spawned against you

Connecting certain tiles will give you units, mana to cast spells, or other effects. Some tiles are harmful so be careful!

Feel free to give it a go or take the code for your own purposes :)
